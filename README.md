You could be trying lots of different options of who you target, what kind of countries, what kind of age groups. It's just on and on. The problem is, if you don't have a clear list of priorities, if you don't know what is important and what is not important, you're going to waste a lot of time and money.

# Differences between SEO and ASO

1. **User Behavior:**

   - SEO: People often type full sentences in search engines like Google, e.g., "amazing apple pie recipes for beginners on a budget".
   - ASO: In app stores, users typically use short phrases or keywords like "apple pie" or "apple pie recipe".

2. **Commitment Level:**

   - SEO: Clicking on websites requires minimal commitment. Users can easily open multiple tabs without any significant consequence.
   - ASO: Installing an app involves a perceived higher commitment due to factors like phone storage, download time, and data usage. The psychological perception of commitment is also more profound.

3. **Presentation:**
   - SEO: Primarily text-based, with search results displaying links and descriptions.
   - ASO: Offers a mix of text and visuals, including screenshots, videos, and other graphic elements.

These differences emphasize the unique considerations needed for optimizing website content (SEO) versus app store content (ASO). The subsequent video will dive into the foundational elements of ASO.

# Fundamental Pillars of ASO (ASL)

In this video, the key elements of App Store Optimization (often mistakenly referred to as ASL in the text) were discussed. The four central pillars of ASO are:

1. **Logo (App Icon):**

   - Often the first thing users notice.
   - Can significantly influence a user's decision to install or skip an app based on its appearance alone.

2. **Screenshots:**

   - Holds immense visual importance in the app store.
   - Considered a major influencer in conversion rates, determining whether users will install the app or not.

3. **Videos:**

   - Their effectiveness varies: works better for games than for apps.
   - Not all apps benefit from having a video presentation, but this will be discussed in detail in future lessons.

4. **Metadata (Keywords):**
   - Crucial from an algorithmic standpoint, determining how an app ranks in search results.
   - It doesn't directly influence user psychology but is essential for app visibility.

Each of these elements will be explored in-depth in upcoming lessons. The subsequent video will focus on the app icon, its significance, and best practices.

# App Logo

In this video tutorial, we learned about the importance of an app's icon and the distinct approaches for designing icons for apps and games. Let's summarize the key takeaways:

1. **Difference between Apps and Games Icons:**

   - Apps: Generally use the brand or company logo or the name of the app itself.
   - Games: Often utilize game visuals or a popular character's face/body. They typically avoid using text or titles in the icon.

2. **User-Centered Design:**

   - Understand your target audience and design your app's icon accordingly. Consider factors like color, shapes, and other visual elements that will resonate with them.

3. **Check the Competition:**

   - While it's not recommended to copy, you can certainly derive inspiration from competitors that are performing well. Analyze their design choices and think about how you can differentiate your icon while still appealing to your audience.

4. **Experimentation:**

   - Don't settle for just one version of your icon. A/B testing, experimenting with colors, and tweaking designs can result in better conversion rates.

5. **Consistency across Platforms:**

   - While it's not crucial to have identical icons on iOS and Android, maintaining some semblance of brand consistency is essential.

6. **Design Tools & Platforms:**
   - **Canva**: An easy-to-use design platform for creating app icons with various templates.
   - **Fiverr**: A platform to find freelancers who can design custom logos for your app.
   - **EasyAppIcon**: A website that generates various sizes of your app icon suitable for different devices and platforms.

Remember, the app icon is often the first visual touchpoint users have with your app. Hence, ensuring it's well-designed, user-centric, and aligned with your brand can significantly influence a user's decision to download your app. Always keep the user in mind, and continually iterate based on feedback and results.

# Successful Screenshots: A Visual Walkthrough

_Interesting Facts:_

- People only spend 7 seconds on your appstore before they either move on to another app or install the app => You only have 7 seconds to capture audience.
- Only 9% of people will actually scroll through all of the screenshots => Focus on the first three screenshots

Alright, let's dive into some examples of successful screenshots from both the App Store (iOS) and the Play Store (Android). By analyzing these examples, you'll get a better grasp of the principles we discussed earlier.

_Remember, the key principles are:_

1. **Communicate the Benefit**: Instead of just talking about what your app does (features), you should convey the value or the advantage a user will gain by using the app. => What the person will get out of the experience, not what the actual app does.

   - Feature: You have 5,000 recipes that can be filtered by price and complexity.
   - Benefit: You have recipes that help people lose weight and don't require much time.

2. **Uphold Brand Identity**: The aesthetics and design of your screenshot should communicate the identity of your brand, making it both attractive and trustworthy to potential users.

   - The standard for communication is high on the visual side, so you need to make sure that your screenshots are absolutely stunning.

**iOS App Store Examples:**

1. **Fitness App**

   - _Screenshot 1_: A well-toned individual using the app with a headline "Achieve your fitness goals faster!"
   - _Screenshot 2_: A snapshot of a customized workout plan with text "Tailored workouts just for you!"
   - _Screenshot 3_: A motivational community feed with "Join a community that motivates you!"

   _Analysis_: Here, instead of just saying "5000+ workouts", the app communicates the benefit of tailored workouts and the value of a motivating community.

2. **Recipe App**

   - _Screenshot 1_: A delicious meal with the caption "Cook mouth-watering dishes effortlessly!"
   - _Screenshot 2_: Filters being adjusted with the text "Find recipes based on ingredients you have!"
   - _Screenshot 3_: A quick tutorial video playing with "Learn with step-by-step videos!"

   _Analysis_: Rather than just stating the number of recipes, the screenshots highlight ease of cooking, customization, and learning through videos.

**Play Store (Android) Examples:**

1. **Productivity App**

   - _Screenshot 1_: A clean task list interface with the text "Stay on top of your tasks effortlessly!"
   - _Screenshot 2_: Calendar integration highlighted with "Never miss a deadline again!"
   - _Screenshot 3_: App widget on a phone home screen, "Access tasks right from your home screen!"

   _Analysis_: The emphasis here is on ease of use, integration, and accessibility. No mention of "100+ features" but instead the benefit of not missing out on tasks and deadlines.

2. **Adventure Game**

   - _Screenshot 1_: A thrilling scene from the game with the title "Embark on a legendary adventure!"
   - _Screenshot 2_: A character choosing weapons, "Customize your hero's weapons & skills!"
   - _Screenshot 3_: Multiplayer mode being showcased with "Team up with friends and conquer!"

   _Analysis_: The game doesn't just highlight its graphics but the excitement of adventure, customization, and social play.

To conclude, when designing screenshots for your app or game, it's essential to put yourself in the shoes of a potential user. What would entice them? What value do they gain from your app or game? Those are the stories you want your screenshots to tell.

Lastly, regarding getting those stunning screenshots: today, there are multiple tools and platforms online that help in designing professional app screenshots. Tools like `AppInstitute's Screenshot Maker`, `Placeit`, and `AppLaunchpad` can be invaluable. Always ensure you adhere to the size and design requirements of each platform for the best results.

Grab a coffee, dive deep into crafting those screenshots, and remember, it's the first impression that often counts the most in the app world. Good luck!

# App and Game Video Promotions: A Summary

Promoting apps and games using videos can dramatically impact user engagement and conversion on App Stores and Play Stores. Dive into the nuances of using videos effectively:

**1. Role of Videos in Promotion:**

- **User Perspective**: Viewers want to get a taste of gameplay or app functionality before downloading.
- **Engagement Levels**: Videos often work exceptionally well for games, less consistently for apps.

**2. Platform and Type Variations:**

- **iOS vs. Android**: Features like autoplay on WiFi on the App Store affect user engagement with videos.
- **Apps vs. Games**: Games usually emphasize videos more due to their visual and interactive nature.

**3. Strategy for Video Content:**

- **Showcase Real Experience**: For games, highlight actual gameplay; for apps, display core benefits or features.
- **Quality vs. Quantity**: While games might require high-quality videos, apps can sometimes get by with simpler visuals.

**4. Producing Videos:**

**a. In-House Production:**

- _Pros_: Control over content and style.
- _Cons_: Can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.

**b. Outsourcing:**

- _Pros_: Access to professional quality and expertise.
- _Cons_: Cost can be a factor; essential to provide clear guidelines to external teams.

**5. Key Points to Remember:**

# Understanding ASO Metadata: A Summary

In the realm of App Store Optimization (ASO), both human and algorithmic forces play pivotal roles in determining an app's visibility and success. Let's delve deeper into the importance of metadata and its impact:

**1. The Two Fundamental ASO Forces:**

- **Human Force**: Targets the actual users of the App Store. Tools to entice this audience include images, videos, icons, and readable text.
- **Algorithmic Force**: Governed by the App Store's algorithm, it decides an app's rank based on keywords.

**2. Importance of Different Elements:**

- **Screenshots**: Central to the human force, they directly influence user's decision to download.
- **Metadata and Keywords**: They play a cardinal role in the algorithmic driving force.

**3. Metadata Insights:**

- **iOS**:
  - Key components include the app name (e.g., Vitality Mental Health Trainer) and subtitle (e.g., Emotional Health and Mind Coach).
  - The submission version further offers a description and a keywords field.
  - "What's New" and promo texts aren't indexed by the algorithm.
- **Play Store**:
  - The main store listing comprises the app name, short description, and full description.

**4. Importance of Metadata Selection:**

- **Visibility Impact**: The choice of metadata can either skyrocket your app to prominence or make it obscure.
- **Striking the Balance**: The optimal metadata is both human-readable and algorithm-optimized.

**5. Key Takeaway**:

The goal of ASO is to ensure when a specific keyword (like "meditation") is searched, your relevant app tops the list. Achieving this requires a nuanced understanding of metadata and effective keyword usage.

**In Conclusion**:

With the right blend of keywords and metadata, you can bridge the divide between human and algorithmic forces in ASO. The next section will delve deeper into the intricacies of metadata, guiding you to optimize your app's visibility. Ready to dive in? Let's explore.

### How to create the ultimate Title

**iOS App Title: Understanding its Significance**

In this lesson, we focused solely on iOS, emphasizing the vital role the app title plays in ASO. Let's recap the key points:

**1. Two Driving Forces in ASO:**

- **Human Force**: Screenshots stand out as the most crucial element. They give potential users a visual sense of the app's functionality.
- **Algorithmic Force**: Metadata is at the forefront, directing how the app is indexed and how it ranks in search results.

**2. Principle of Priority in Metadata:**

- The App Title (or App Name) holds the topmost priority in the algorithm.
- This is followed by the Subtitle, Keyword field, and finally the Description.

**3. Delving Deeper into the App Title:**

- It can be up to 30 characters long, including letters, spaces, and special characters.
- Words placed at the beginning of the title hold more weight with the algorithm than those at the end.
- While keyword optimization is vital, it's equally crucial to maintain human readability.

**4. What to Include and What Not to:**

- Typically, it's advisable to lead with the brand name, followed by one or two significant keywords.
- Avoid using competitor brand names in your metadata.
- There's no need to use words like "app," "iOS," or "iPhone" in the title as all apps naturally rank for these terms.

**5. Looking Ahead**:

- In the upcoming lessons, we'll delve into keyword research, helping you identify and optimize the right keywords for your app title and ensure top rankings in your category.

It's essential to remember that while the app title plays a foundational role in ASO, a holistic approach encompassing all aspects of metadata will ensure optimal results.

# Craft a Subtitle that will get you more installs (iOS)

**iOS Subtitle: A Key Component in ASO**

In this lesson, we're diving into the significance of the iOS subtitle in the realm of App Store Optimization (ASO). Let's review the main points:

**1. Character Limitation**:

- Just like the title, the subtitle also has a limit of up to 30 characters, counting spaces and other characters.

**2. Principle of Priority**:

- When it comes to ASO, the subtitle holds the second most crucial position following the title.
- This principle implies that the algorithm gives more weight to the beginning characters of your subtitle than the ending ones.

**3. Strategic Keyword Placement**:

- As you conduct your keyword research, you'll likely compile a list of significant keywords.
- It's advisable to place the most vital keywords in the title and then use the subtitle to incorporate the next tier of important keywords.
- Always remember to place the more important keywords at the beginning of the subtitle for maximum impact.

**4. Visibility in Search**:

- An essential aspect of the subtitle is its visibility during search. When users search for an app on the App Store, both the title and subtitle appear in the search results.
- This visibility can influence potential users' decision to click on your app. A compelling subtitle can enhance conversion rates.

**5. Upcoming Lessons**:

- In the forthcoming lessons, we'll delve deeper into other metadata elements vital for ASO, like the keyword field.

In summary, while the app title remains paramount, the subtitle serves as a powerful tool in conveying your app's essence and attracting potential users. It's crucial to utilize this space wisely by balancing keyword optimization and user readability.

# How to optimize your Keyword Field(iOS)

**The iOS Keyword Field: A Behind-The-Scenes Powerhouse**

Welcome to this lesson where we'll be unpacking the keyword field, an integral but concealed component of App Store Optimization (ASO). Let's break down the key points:

**1. Character Capacity**:

- The keyword field offers space for up to 100 characters.

**2. Visibility**:

- Unlike the title and subtitle, the keyword field is clandestine. It's not accessible to App Store users. This feature lets you incorporate vital keywords without directly impacting the user's perception of your app.

**3. Proper Formatting**:

- One common pitfall many app developers encounter is inputting spaces between keywords. However, since this section is invisible to users, spaces serve no purpose and are redundant.
- The right way to input multiple keywords is to separate them using commas, without spaces. This approach ensures optimal use of the available character count.

**4. Principle of Priority**:

- In the hierarchy of ASO, the keyword field is third in line after the title and subtitle.
- As with the previous fields, the algorithm gives more significance to the initial keywords in comparison to the latter ones in the keyword field.

**5. Using Competitor Names**:

- Incorporating competitor names in the keyword field can be tempting and, while some developers may have done it without facing repercussions, it's a grey area. Officially, it's frowned upon by Apple's guidelines.
- While it might be a strategy employed by some, it's prudent to tread carefully. It's always recommended to abide by the rules and ensure you're not infringing on another entity's intellectual property or rights.

**6. Upcoming Topics**:

- In the next lesson, we'll explore the 'promo text' and the 'what's new' sections on the App Store, diving into how these features can further enhance your app's appeal and visibility.

In summation, while the keyword field remains concealed from the user's eye, it wields a considerable influence over your app's discoverability on the App Store. Thus, strategic keyword selection and optimal formatting are paramount to maximize this tool's potential.

# The ultimate App Store Description

**Recommdend Structure**

- Don't forget to put keywords
- Only 5% of people will start reading descriptions

1. Testimonials
2. Features
3. Transparent Subscription

**The Art of Crafting an App Store Description**

Welcome to our lesson on constructing an effective app store description! This section holds a significant place in App Store Optimization (ASO), despite being overlooked by many. Let's explore its intricacies:

**1. Size & Significance**:

- The description offers a generous space of up to 4,000 characters.
- Surprisingly, only a small percentage (about 5%) of users actually delve into the description. Most scan or skip it altogether.

**2. Optimizing for Algorithm vs. Users**:

- Given its vast size and the tendency of users to skip over it, the description is primarily an area to cater to the algorithm. This means strategically inserting relevant keywords to improve your app's visibility.

**3. The Power of Testimonials**:

- Starting your description with testimonials or positive feedback from satisfied users can immediately establish trust and credibility. Authentic praise can have a persuasive effect on potential users.

**4. Highlighting Features and Benefits**:

- A structured list, preferably with bullet points, detailing the app's benefits and features provides a clear and concise snapshot of what the app offers. This can be a quick reference for those few who do peruse the description.

**5. Transparent Subscription & Pricing Information**:

- Clearly detailing any subscription models, pricing, and features of premium versions can eliminate ambiguity and potential user dissatisfaction.

**6. Outsourcing or Automating the Writing**:

- If writing isn't your strength or if you're pressed for time, platforms like Fiverr offer freelancers who specialize in crafting app store descriptions.
- On the cutting edge, AI-driven tools can also be harnessed to generate descriptions, ensuring they are optimized for both the algorithm and the end-user.

**7. Upcoming Topics**:

- In our subsequent lesson, we'll shift focus to the 'promo text' and the 'what's new' sections. These elements further contribute to how your app is perceived and how well it ranks on the App Store.

In summary, the app store description is a canvas to paint a compelling picture of your app, both for the algorithm and the discerning user. Properly leveraging this space can significantly impact your app's success.

# Other iOS metadata pieces

**Promo Text & What's New: Making an Impact Beyond Algorithms**

Welcome back! In this lesson, we're wrapping up our discussion on app metadata by diving into two elements that directly cater to your users: the 'Promo Text' and the 'What's New' section.

**1. Understanding their Placement**:

- **Promo Text**: Positioned above your app description yet below the screenshots, the promo text offers a brief spotlight to capture user attention.
- **What's New**: Located above the screenshots, this section provides insights into the latest updates or features of your app.

**2. Algorithmic Significance**:

- Based on various studies and opinions, it appears that both 'Promo Text' and 'What's New' don't significantly impact algorithmic rankings.
- While some argue these sections are indexed, evidence leans towards them not being a primary factor in ASO (App Store Optimization).

**3. Leveraging Promo Text**:

- Limited to 170 characters, it serves as a flexible tool to showcase timely events or offers.
- Unlike the app name or subtitle, the promo text can be altered without needing to submit an app update.
- Example Use Case: For an e-commerce app, this space can highlight limited-time sales or offers.

**4. Maximizing 'What's New'**:

- Here, transparency is key. Inform users about recent changes, be it bug fixes, added features, or other improvements. This fosters trust and can encourage updates or fresh downloads.

**5. Their Primary Role**:
While they may not play a major role in the algorithm, 'Promo Text' and 'What's New' enhance user experience. They provide clarity, promote engagement, and can positively influence conversions.

**Up Next**: As we transition from Apple's App Store nuances, our upcoming lessons will delve into the world of Android, exploring essential metadata elements such as the app name, long description, and short description. Stay tuned!

# The perfect Android Title

**Crafting the Perfect Title for Your Android App**

Welcome back! Today, we're zoning in on one of the most critical components of your app's presence on the Google Play Store: the title. Let's unpack its significance, guidelines, and best practices.

**1. Understanding the Title's Constraints**:

- The title grants you a concise 30 characters, encompassing spaces and special characters.
- It's not just a name but a significant factor in the app's discoverability and initial appeal to potential users.

**2. The Principle of Priority**:

- While the app title, short description, and long description are all important, the title takes precedence in terms of SEO weight.
- Furthermore, within the title, prioritize placing the most impactful keywords closer to the start, as they wield greater influence on search algorithms.

**3. Striking a Balance**:

- Your app's brand name typically takes pole position, followed by relevant keywords.
- The challenge lies in ensuring the title is both user-friendly (easy to read and understand) and optimized for the algorithm.

**4. Staying Within Play Store Guidelines**:

- Steer clear of "performance-based" words. Terms like "best" or "#1" are frowned upon as they can seem misleading.
- Refrain from including calls-to-action such as "download now" or "get it today". Google prefers a more direct, informative approach.
- While generic terms are permissible, avoid using competitor brand names or trademarks. Remember, authenticity and originality are pivotal.

**5. To Summarize**:
The title isn't just a name – it's your app's first impression, its beacon for discovery, and a statement of its purpose. Craft it with care, keeping both users and the algorithm in mind.

**Up Next**: Now that we've grasped the nuances of an app title, our following lesson will explore the 'short description' and its role in enhancing your app's presence on the Play Store. Join us!

# Short Description to get more installs(Android)

**Diving into the Android Short Description**

Welcome to today's topic, where we delve into the nuances of the 'short description' on the Google Play Store and understand its significance in your app's discoverability and appeal.

**1. Importance & Length**:

- The 'short description' is a crucial metadata component on Android, ranking second in the hierarchy of importance, following the title.
- You have a generous 80-character limit, allowing for a more expansive range of keywords compared to iOS's 30-character constraints for title and subtitle.

**2. Crafting the Perfect Short Description**:

- Think of it as your app's elevator pitch. Within those 80 characters, you want to convey the core functionality and benefits of your app succinctly.
- Prioritize clarity over creativity. The goal is to provide potential users with a clear snapshot of what your app offers.

**3. Google's Guidelines**:

- Steer clear of "performance-based" words. Terms like "best" or "top-rated" can come off as promotional rather than informative.
- Avoid calls-to-action such as "try now" or "join today". Instead, focus on conveying the primary function or benefit of your app.
- The emphasis should always be on genuine and accurate representation of your app's core functionalities and benefits.

**4. The Role of Keywords**:

- While the short description offers a broader character limit, ensure you're judicious with keyword inclusion. The goal is not just to optimize for search but also to appeal to human readers.
- Use keywords that genuinely align with your app's functionality and can succinctly describe its main offerings.

**5. In Conclusion**:
The short description serves as a brief, yet impactful, introduction to what your app brings to the table. Use those 80 characters wisely to showcase your app's essence while adhering to Google's guidelines for authenticity and clarity.

**Up Next**: As we continue our journey into optimizing your app's presence on the Play Store, our next lesson will delve into the 'long description'. Stay tuned!

# The ideal Long Description (Android)

- Don't use the most important keywords in there!

**Stucture**

- Testimonials
- List of Features & Benefits
- Subscription Info
- Benefits of Premium Product

**The Power of Android's Long Description**

Welcome back! Today, we focus on one of the most extensive metadata elements for your app on the Play Store: the long description. While often overlooked, this section has tremendous potential, both for search optimization and for communicating with potential users.

**1. Quantity Meets Quality**:

- With a generous limit of 4000 characters, the long description provides ample space for keyword optimization. But remember, quality always trumps sheer quantity.

**2. Reading Habits**:

- Statistics indicate that only a small fraction, around 5%, of users will dive deep into the long description. Even then, their attention is primarily on the opening sections. Use this to your advantage by front-loading the most compelling information.

**3. Authenticity Over Repetition**:

- While it might be tempting to repeat keywords for algorithmic optimization, overdoing it can come off as inauthentic. Instead, aim for a natural flow that incorporates essential keywords organically.

**4. The Power of Testimonials**:

- Nothing speaks louder than the voices of satisfied users. Placing testimonials or user feedback at the beginning can lend credibility and trustworthiness to your app, encouraging more downloads.

**5. Highlight Features with Lists**:

- A structured list, complete with bullet points detailing the app's features and benefits, can provide clarity. Plus, on Android, you can leverage emojis and special characters to make the list engaging and visually appealing.

**6. Transparent Subscription Information**:

- If your app offers premium features, be transparent about the associated costs, benefits, and subscription details towards the end of the description.

**7. Outsourcing & AI**:

- Writing a captivating long description can be daunting. If you're pressed for time or unsure of your writing skills, platforms like Fiverr offer specialized services. Another intriguing avenue is leveraging AI for content creation, a topic we'll delve into in a subsequent lesson.

**In Conclusion**:
While the long description might seem secondary given its length and the limited readership, it's an underutilized tool that can significantly impact your app's discoverability and conversions. Utilize the space wisely, balancing between algorithmic optimization and genuine user appeal.

**Stay Tuned**: In our next segment, we will discuss the innovative ways AI can assist in crafting app descriptions that resonate and rank. Don't miss it!

3. **Content Frequency and Length**: Consistency reigns supreme, but unlike short video platforms, YouTube favors slightly longer content. The sweet spot for video length is between 8 and 30 minutes. Aspiring YouTubers should aim for at least one video a week.

4. **Content Planning**: Bulk content creation can be a lifesaver, especially on a platform like YouTube. It's efficient to have a cache of videos ready to go to maintain consistency without the stress of last-minute creation.

5. **Content Nature**: YouTube viewers generally expect content that educates or entertains. And while the platform does favor content with a personal touch, such as face-to-camera videos, starting simple is better than not starting at all.

6. **Getting Started**: Don't let the lack of professional equipment or perceived perfection stop you. An iPhone and natural lighting can be enough to begin your journey into YouTube content creation.

7. **Audience-centric Creation**: Tailor your videos to meet the interests and needs of your audience, not just your personal preferences. Use tools like Tube Buddy for keyword research to optimize your video titles, descriptions, and tags, thus aligning your content with what the audience is searching for.

8. **Action Over Perfection**: The best strategy is to begin with what you have. Learn as you go and improve your setup over time. Procrastination due to a desire for perfection only hinders progress.

**Takeaway Message:**

Start with your audience's needs in mind and create content that serves them. YouTube's value comes from its ability to bring you closer to an engaged audience that could turn into loyal customers. Remember, in content creation, especially on YouTube, consistent action trumps all. Now, grab your phone or camera, make your first video, and join the YouTube community. 🎥🌟📈

# Text-based (LinkedIn, Medium, Twitter, Blogs)

- LinkedIn is a fantastic platform for B2B or professional audiences.
  - Create Articles
  - Writing a proper blog post
  - Consistency is the key
- Twitter
  - Consistency
- Tips for production
  - You could get someone to write articles, turn my videos and podcasts into articles.

**Maximizing Text-Based Platforms for Growth: A Summary**

**Key Points:**

1. **LinkedIn as a B2B Hub**: LinkedIn shines for B2B (Business to Business) and professional audience engagement. It's a prime spot for sharing well-crafted, professional articles that provide value to your industry peers.

2. **Articles over Posts**: On LinkedIn, deep-dive articles often perform better than simple posts. Thorough, informative pieces like tutorials or guides garner more attention and establish authority.

3. **Consistency is Crucial**: As with any social media platform, maintaining a regular posting schedule is essential. Consistency in posting frequency can help build a dedicated following.

4. **Leveraging AI**: Tools like Jasper AI can assist in content creation by generating articles. This could potentially save time, but caution is advised to avoid potential platform penalties, such as shadow banning, which has been experienced on video-based platforms.

5. **Turning Videos into Text**: If you’re already creating video content, repurposing it into written form for LinkedIn or other text-based platforms can maximize your reach without requiring extra content creation effort.

6. **Twitter's Unique Pace**: While Twitter is known for short, snappy content, the principle of consistency remains the same. Daily posts, or even multiple posts per day, can help you break through the noise and grow your presence.

**Content Tips:**

- **Thought Leadership**: Share insights, opinions, and thought-provoking content to engage and grow your audience.
- **Engagement**: Responding to comments, engaging with other posts, and being an active participant in your industry's conversation can increase visibility.

- **Trending Topics**: Tap into current events, trending hashtags, and popular conversations relevant to your industry to increase your content's reach.

**Takeaway Message:**

Whether your platform of choice is LinkedIn for in-depth professional articles or Twitter for quick, engaging updates, the key to success is providing valuable content consistently. Consider experimenting with AI tools to streamline content creation, but proceed with caution and monitor the impact. Above all, begin by assessing your strengths – whether you excel in video or text – and then find ways to cross-pollinate content across different platforms to maximize your marketing efforts. 🌐✍️📈

# Audio-based (Podcasts)

- Consistency is the key
- Podcasts are very long formats
- Incredible Benefits
  - Super Long Format
  - If somebody listens to you for an hour, they start to trust you
  - for 1 hour ~ 4 hours
- Quality matters
- Contents Format
  - Interview
  - Talk about different topics
    - Bigger Topics
    - My first million dollars story for example
- But this platforms require a lot of energy

  **Key Takeaways from the Lecture on Podcasts:**

1. **Long-Form Content Connection**: Podcasts allow for long-form content, meaning your audience engages with your voice and message for extended periods, fostering a deeper connection and trust.

2. **Cross-Platform Synergy**: Podcasts can be the content core, with their audio repurposed across various platforms — videos for YouTube, snippets for social media, and transcripts for articles or blog posts.

3. **Popular Podcast Formats**: Interviews and conversational formats (like "My First Million") are particularly popular, drawing in listeners with expert insights or dynamic discussions.

4. **The Work Behind the Mic**: While it might seem straightforward, podcasts require effort — from planning and recording to editing and distributing. It's often more work than anticipated.

5. **Consider Outsourcing Editing**: Editing can be outsourced to professionals on platforms like Fiverr or Upwork to ensure a polished final product without the need to master audio editing yourself.

6. **Commit to Consistency**: Like other content mediums, consistent posting schedules are vital for building an audience. Quality, however, should not be sacrificed for frequency.

7. **Sound Quality Matters**: In podcasting, audio quality can't be compromised. Investing in a decent microphone is essential for retaining listeners.

8. **Anchor FM for Distribution**: Anchor FM is recommended for podcast distribution. It simplifies the process by distributing episodes to multiple platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

**Practical Advice:**

- **Start Small**: Test podcasting first. Record a few episodes to gauge the time and work involved before fully committing.
- **Quality Microphone**: You don't need to break the bank, but a quality microphone is a non-negotiable investment for podcasting.
- **Use Anchor FM**: Take advantage of free distribution services like Anchor FM to ease the process and expand your reach.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Consider Your Content**: Ensure your podcast's content aligns with your brand and provides value, whether through education, entertainment, or inspiring conversations.
2. **Get the Right Equipment**: Invest in a good microphone and possibly a pop filter to improve sound quality.
3. **Record and Test**: Create a few episodes to understand the workflow and decide if podcasting fits into your content strategy.
4. **Plan Your Schedule**: Determine a realistic posting schedule that balances quality content and consistency.
5. **Explore Distribution Tools**: Look into tools like Anchor FM to streamline your podcast distribution across various platforms.

**Final Thoughts:**

Podcasting can be a powerful tool in your content arsenal, offering a unique way to engage deeply with your audience. While it requires a bit of upfront investment in equipment and learning, the potential for personal connection and content repurposing is significant. Whether you're sharing expertise or capturing intriguing dialogues, a well-executed podcast can enrich your brand's voice and expand your reach. 🎙️📢📻

# Group Based (Reddit, Facebook)

- Become a member of community and contribute by being helpful, by answering, by doing a lot of work for free, then you are going to get some leads.
- It doesn't really work at scale
- If you're starting from zero and if an app or game has no attention right now
  - Creating conversation and engagement and feedback is great
- Facebook groups are a great way again to engage and answer questions
- Subreddits are a great way to find lots of fantastic engaging niches. But you have to be very careful not to be spammy, not to seem like you're advertising.
- Quora is great
- WhatsApp is a great channel

---

**Key Takeaways from the Lecture on Group-Based Platforms:**

1. **Value Contribution**: The key to leveraging group-based platforms is to provide value and be helpful within the community. Spamming links without contributing meaningfully will not be effective.

2. **Niche Targeting**: These platforms are excellent for finding and engaging with niche audiences that align closely with your product or service.

3. **Scalability Limitations**: While group-based platforms are great for initial growth, they may not be effective for large-scale user acquisition.

4. **LinkedIn Groups**: Professional and industry-focused groups on LinkedIn can be valuable for B2B connections and early user recruitment.

5. **Facebook Groups**: Still highly active, these groups allow for deeper community engagement around shared interests or needs.

6. **Reddit Subreddits**: Highly engaged communities exist around almost every topic on Reddit. However, overt advertising is frowned upon, so subtlety and genuine contribution are key.

7. **Quora**: Answering questions related to your expertise can establish credibility and lead to organic discovery of your product or service.

8. **WhatsApp Groups**: Less public but can be a potent tool if you can find groups relevant to your market.

**Practical Advice:**

- **Research Relevant Groups**: Invest time in finding groups that align closely with your target market or where your potential users may be active.
- **Engage Authentically**: Participate in discussions, offer advice, and share experiences without pushing your product aggressively.
- **Be Patient and Consistent**: Establishing a presence and trust within these groups takes time and consistency in your valuable contributions.
- **Use AI Sparingly**: While AI can help with engagement, it's crucial to maintain a human touch in interactions to build genuine relationships.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Identify Groups**: Use search functions and community suggestions to find groups on LinkedIn, Facebook, Reddit, Quora, and even WhatsApp that are relevant to your product.
2. **Engage with Content**: Start by contributing to existing conversations. Share insights, answer questions, and provide value without immediately linking to your product.
3. **Share Thoughtfully**: When the opportunity arises naturally, share your product as a potential solution to a problem being discussed.
4. **Monitor and Respond**: Stay active and responsive to any follow-up comments or questions that arise from your contributions.

**Final Thoughts:**

Group-based platforms offer a unique opportunity to engage directly with highly targeted, engaged communities. While they are not a one-size-fits-all solution for growth, for the right product and audience, they can provide a strong foundation of early adopters and valuable feedback. Remember, your goal is to become a respected member of the community first — growth and user acquisition will follow from the trust and authority you build. 🌐🤝🚀

# PR-based

- Not that many audience
- Mostly tourist users
  - Conversion rate is low
- Not long-term marketing growth strategy

**_Three Main Ways_**

- https://www.helpareporter.com/
- Hire agency => Press something you pay for
- Hard grind yourself. Message 1,000 reporters

**Key Takeaways from the Lecture on Press and PR:**

1. **Expectation Management**: Press releases and PR stunts often do not translate into the significant user growth that many expect. They may bring visibility but not necessarily sustained growth or the right kind of users.

2. **User Demographics**: Press can attract many 'tourist users' who may check out your app out of curiosity but are not necessarily part of your target demographic, which can lead to lower conversion rates.

3. **PR is not a Growth Strategy**: The boost from PR is typically temporary. It does not establish a long-term growth path for user acquisition.

4. **Newsworthiness Standards**: Simply launching a new product is often not enough to garner press attention in the current media climate. Significant or unique achievements or innovations are required.

5. **Methods to Gain Press**:

   - **Help a Reporter Out (HARO)**: This platform connects reporters to experts. It’s a more targeted approach where you can provide expertise relevant to journalists' inquiries.
   - **Hiring a PR Agency**: This can be an expensive option where payment may influence the press coverage. It is effective but may not be cost-efficient in terms of user acquisition.
   - **Direct Outreach**: Contacting reporters individually can be labor-intensive and has a low success rate unless you have a notably compelling story to tell.

6. **PR for Fundraising**: Having been featured in reputable publications can serve as a credibility marker when seeking investment, as it may help in getting through the door with potential investors.

7. **Real Value of PR**: The actual impact of PR on your business could be minimal. It may not increase your customer base or sales but could feed into vanity metrics.

**Practical Advice:**

- **Strategic PR**: Consider PR efforts if they align with your business goals, like fundraising or creating brand awareness, rather than direct user acquisition.
- **Be Newsworthy**: Focus on developing unique aspects of your product that could naturally attract media attention.
- **Budget Wisely**: Assess if the potential cost of PR campaigns is worth the outcome, considering the actual return on investment in terms of user growth.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Evaluate Goals**: Determine if PR aligns with your current business objectives.
2. **Prepare Your Pitch**: Craft a compelling narrative about your product or company that stands out.
3. **Select a Strategy**: Decide whether to use platforms like HARO, hire a PR agency, or undertake the direct outreach based on resources and potential ROI.
4. **Leverage Success**: If you do get press coverage, use it strategically for fundraising or to build brand credibility, rather than solely for user acquisition.

**Final Thoughts:**

Press and PR can still play a valuable role in your overall business strategy, especially when it comes to brand building and fundraising. However, when it comes to user growth, it’s important to keep expectations realistic and focus on strategies with proven ROI. Press coverage should be seen as a supplementary tool, not a core strategy for user acquisition. 🗞️💼🚀

# How to solve the Attribution problem

- Mobile attribution is the process of attributing certain users to certain marketing campaigns.
- This only makes sense if you are running campaigns on several different marketing channels.
- If you are only running ads on one channel, you don't need attribution.

**Platforms**

- Branch, Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP)
  - https://www.branch.io/
- Adjust
  - https://try.adjust.com/
- Appsflyer
  - https://www.appsflyer.com/ko/

---

Mobile attribution is indeed an essential component for those delving into paid advertising, especially when the aim is to accurately track the user journey from ad click to app action. Here's a summary of the lecture:

- **Mobile Attribution Basics**: The process involves tracking and attributing user actions, such as app installs or purchases, to specific marketing campaigns.

- **Privacy Focused Platforms**: Apple and Google prioritize user privacy, which presents challenges for tracking across the web. Unlike web cookies that track user behavior across sites, mobile attribution in the app ecosystem is less straightforward due to these privacy constraints.

- **Third-Party Solutions**: To bridge the tracking gap, third-party mobile attribution providers like Branch and Adjust offer tools to help correlate marketing efforts with user actions. These platforms are essential for campaigns spread across multiple channels, allowing marketers to understand where their conversions are coming from.

- **Economics of Attribution Tools**: While useful, these tools can be costly and may not be necessary for businesses running single-channel campaigns. The utility of such tools increases with the complexity and scale of the advertising efforts.

- **Data Accuracy**: Even with attribution tools, there is an acknowledgment that the data might not always be perfect. Marketers should be aware of the potential discrepancies and the "gray data" that might not be crystal clear.

- **Cost and Necessity**: The discussion touches on the point that these tools can become expensive, and companies should weigh the cost against the benefits they provide. It's suggested that mobile attribution tools are not crucial at the early stages of app marketing, especially when operating on a tight budget or a single advertising channel.

The lecture emphasizes the importance of attribution but also brings to light the trade-offs between the costs, benefits, and the point in the business lifecycle where such tools become truly beneficial. The key takeaway is to carefully consider when and how to integrate mobile attribution into your marketing strategy.

# My Four-Step-Testing-System

- When you start advertising, there is a thousand different decisions you could be making. There's lots of different channels, lots of different pictures or videos, different types of content. You could be trying lots of different options of who you target, what kind of countries, what kind of age groups. It's just on and on. The problem is, if you don't have a clear list of priorities, if you don't know what is important and what is not important, you're going to waste a lot of time and money.
- Most platforms require $10,000 spending for optimization

1. Channel
   - User behavior is different
   - Go to where your users are
2. Audience, Targeting Number
3. The creative
   - Test different types of contents
4. Conversion Optimization
   - 1% improvement

**Summary of Lecture on Four-Step Testing System for Paid Advertising:**

1. **Channel Priority**: The platform where you choose to run your ads is crucial. The creative could be exceptional, but if the channel doesn't align with where your target audience spends their time, the campaign will likely fail. You must select the right platform based on where your core users are active.

2. **Audience and Targeting**: Once the channel is picked, the next priority is targeting the correct audience. Gender, age, interests, location - these are all critical factors in ensuring your ads are served to the most receptive audience possible.

3. **Creative Considerations**: The actual ad content, whether video, audio, or images, comes next. After establishing the right channel and audience, now you can focus on testing different creative elements. Each channel may require different forms of content for optimal engagement.

4. **Conversion Optimization**: The final priority involves the finer details that can nudge conversion rates higher, like tweaking button colors or ad copy. This step only becomes relevant after the first three priorities are adequately addressed.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Start With Broad Decisions**: Begin with overarching choices about channels and audience before diving into creative and minor optimizations.
- **Avoid Wasting Resources**: Concentrating on creative details or conversion tactics too early can lead to inefficient use of time and budget.

- **Systematic Approach**: Adopting this step-by-step approach can help streamline the ad testing process, leading to more effective campaigns and potentially saving substantial amounts of money.

- **Building on Success**: Once you've found a strategy that works on one channel, you can then expand to others, but always start by solidifying your position on the initial platform of choice.

This systematic approach to testing in paid advertising aims to reduce waste and increase the chances of running successful ad campaigns. Remember to start from a high-level strategy and work your way down to the specifics.
